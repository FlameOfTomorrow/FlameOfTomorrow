[FarFarLeft][LoadArtemer][MoveMidLeft][Left][MoveRight][Clear][LoadKeith]
Can we help you?[AN]

[MidLeft]
I am looking for a...[.....][N]
mercenary's... um...[AN]

[FarRight]
Mercenary's guild?[N]
That's us.[AN]

[MidLeft]
That is the word.[AN]

[Right]
Do you need to hire[N]
us for something?[AN]

[MidLeft]
No. I am looking for work.[AN]

[FarFarLeft][LoadVerwald]
Ohh, a new guy eh?[N]
Let me take a look...[AN]
[MoveFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][Clear][MidRight][LoadVerwald][MoveLeft][MoveLeft][Clear][FarLeft][LoadVerwald]
[Smile]Yeah, yeah![AN]
You look like you have[N]
some meat on your bones![AN][Smile]

[Right][CloseEyes]
Hopefully he has some[N]
meat in his head too,[AN]
unlike a certain someone...[AN][OpenEyes]

[FarLeft]
Gahaha! You crack me up, pal.[AN]

[FarRight]
I'm not too sure[N]
he was joking, Verwald...[AN]
[Clear][FarLeft][Clear][FarFarLeft][LoadHelena][MoveFarLeft][MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarFarRight][LoadSpike][MoveFarRight]
Alright, you lot.[N]
I've got our latest job.[AN][....]
...And this is?[AN]

[Left]
I am here looking for work.[AN]

[FarRight]
Fresh meat, huh.[AN]
You look tougher than these little[N]
kids I've been getting recently,[AN]
at least. Welcome aboard...[AN]
Erm...[AN]

[Left][Beat][AN]

[FarRight]
Your name?[AN]

[Left]
I am called Artemer.[AN]

[FarRight]
Right, Artemer.[N]
I'm Spike.[AN]
The rest of you lot[N]
can talk later.[AN]
Helena, give the[N]
briefing, please.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Right.[AN]
It seems like the locals have been[N]
getting robbed more and more lately.[AN]
Those bandits are awful bold of late.[AN]
They're not only taking[N]
valuables, but prisoners as well.[AN]

[Right][Clear][LoadLexi]
Prisoners...[N]
What for? Ransom?[AN]

[Left][Clear][LoadVerwald]
Wish it were so lighthearted,[N]
kid. Those are slaves.[AN]

[FarRight]
God knows what black market[N]
they're being sold on.[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][LoadKeith]
So if I'm understanding right,[AN]
we're breaking into their[N]
base and rescuing those people.[AN]

[FarLeft]
You got the jist of it.[AN]
Be on your guard though - these[N]
bandits won't be pulling punches.[AN]

[Left][Clear][LoadArtemer]
Bandits? They are weak.[AN]

[Right]
What makes you say that?[AN]

[Left]
They lack conviction.[N]
I have killed many before.[AN]
Fell for animal traps.[AN]
Made for animals much[N]
smaller than bandits.[AN]

[Right][Clear][LoadSpike]
Someone sounds sure of himself.[AN]
Say... why don't you[N]
take charge here, buddy?[AN]

[FarRight]
Him? But he just got here...[N]
I don't follow your reasoning.[AN]

[Right]
You'll get it when[N]
you're older, kid.[AN]

[Left]
Very well.[N]
I will take charge.[AN]

[Right]
Excellent.[AN]
You all go get prepared.[N]
Show this guy around.[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][Left][Clear]
[Right][MoveMidRight][FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
He'll get it when[N]
he's older...?[AN]
Get what?[AN]

[MidRight]
He'll get that I'm too[N]
damned old to be babysitting,[AN]
that's what.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Are you sure about this?[AN]

[MidRight]
Relax. It's not like[N]
we're going anywhere.[AN]
You can show him[N]
the ropes and all that.[AN]
Now, I've got my own[N]
preparations to make,[AN]
if you'll excuse me.[AN]
[MoveFarFarLeft][Clear]

[MidLeft][CloseEyes][Beat][A][X]





##PrologueOP2
[FarFarLeft][LoadSpike][MoveLeft]
Alright, here's[N]
the place.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadHelena][FarLeft][LoadKeith]
It's... bigger[N]
than I expected.[AN]

[Left]
Helena, if you would.[AN]
[Left][Clear][FarLeft][Clear]

[MidRight]
We're going to need to[N]
get all the prisoners out.[AN]
Once we open their cells,[AN]
we'll direct them out[N]
here so they can escape.[AN][Event]
Some townsfolk have prepared[N]
wagons to get them out of here.[AN]
After that's done we just[N]
need to reclaim this fort.[AN][Event]
We'll need to defeat their[N]
leader eventually to do so,[AN]
but defeating him earlier[N]
may stop their advance.[AN][Event]

[Left][LoadVerwald]
Nice and simple, huh?[AN]
Come in swinging and[N]
bust them outta there...[AN][CloseEyes][....][....][OpenEyes][MoveLeft]
I like it![AN]

[FarLeft][LoadLexi]
But how are we going[N]
to open the cells?[AN]

[MidRight]
I brought an unlock staff with me.[AN]
The local blacksmith was also kind[N]
enough to give us this master key.[AN]
Artemer can hold onto it for now.[AN]

[Left][Clear][LoadArtemer]
Thank you.[AN]

[FarLeft][Clear][LoadSpike]
If there's no complaints,[N]
let's move already.[AN]
Lead the way, bud.[AN]

[Left]
I will do[N]
my best.[A][X]




##PrologueOP3
[MidRight][LoadGregory][FarFarLeft][LoadPirate][MoveMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Boss![N]
We've got trouble![AN]
Some mercenaries[N]
'ave showed up![AN]

[MidRight]
Those lowly villagers[N]
must have sent them...[AN]
Bastards ought to know[N]
their place in this world.[AN]
We can handle this[N]
lot, no problem.[AN]
Call for the reinforcements![AN]
And if those slave runts[N]
try to escape, kill 'em![AN]
That'll send 'em right on[N]
back into their cells.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sir, yes sir![AN]
[MoveFarFarRight][Clear]

[MidRight][Beat][AN]
Alright, you lug.[N]
[MoveMidLeft][Clear][LoadGregory]
I see you sulking about.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadXanthus]
Hopefully that eyesight of yours[N]
helps you oversee those prisoners.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hmph. You'd do best[N]
to watch your tongue.[AN]
Leave my own business[N]
to me, you snake.[AN]
You'll get your[N]
damned people,[AN]
to whatever ends you[N]
freaks are using them.[AN]

[MidRight]
As long as you hold[N]
your end of our deal.[AN][Smile]
Try not to kill too[N]
many in the meantime, hm?[AN][Smile]
[Clear]

[MidLeft]
I have a feeling I'm involved[N]
in something I shouldn't be...[A][X]




##PrologueGregoryBattle
[MidLeft][LoadGregory]
Didn't expect ya to make it[N]
it all the way up here...[AN]
Looks like I'll get to[N]
have some fun with ya![A][X]




##PrologueGregoryDeath
[MidLeft][LoadGregory]
This ain't... the end[N]
of me... Ya... Urgh...[A][CloseEyes][.....][X]




##ProloguePrisonerWarning
[MidRight][LoadArtemer][MidLeft][LoadSpike]
What the hell are[N]
you doing, pal?[AN]
If these people all die,[N]
we ain't gettin' paid![AN]

[MidRight]
I apoligize.[N]
I lack experience.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Just... try[N]
to focus, huh?[A][X]




##ProloguePrisonerLose
[MidRight][LoadArtemer][MidLeft][LoadSpike]
Another one?![N]
God damnit...[AN]

[MidRight][Beat][AN]

[MidLeft]
Just step aside, bud.[AN]
I'll handle[N]
things from here.[AN]
What a mess...[A][X]
