##PrologueOP1
[Left][LoadKeith][FarRight][LoadLexi][MoveFarRight][Left][MoveLeft][FarRight][MoveFarRight]
[FarFarLeft][LoadArtemer][MoveMidLeft][Left][MoveRight][Clear][LoadKeith]
Can we help you?[AN]

[MidLeft]
I am looking for a...[.....][N]
mercenary's... um...[AN]

[FarRight]
Mercenary's guild?[N]
That's us.[AN]

[MidLeft]
That is the word.[AN]

[Right]
Do you need to hire[N]
us for something?[AN]

[MidLeft]
No. I am looking for work.[AN]

[FarFarLeft][LoadVerwald]
Ohh, a new guy eh?[N]
Let me take a look...[AN]
[MidLeft][MoveLeft][FarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][MoveFarLeft]
[Smile]Yeah, yeah![AN]
You look like you have[N]
some meat on your bones![AN][Smile]

[Right][CloseEyes]
Hopefully he has some[N]
meat in his head too,[AN]
unlike a certain someone...[AN][OpenEyes]

[FarLeft]
Gahaha! You crack me up, pal.[AN]

[FarRight]
I'm not too sure[N]
he was joking, Verwald...[AN]
[Clear][FarLeft][Clear][FarFarLeft][LoadHelena][MoveFarLeft][FarFarRight][LoadSpike][MoveFarRight]
Alright, you lot.[N]
I've got our latest job.[AN][....]
...And this is?[AN]

[Left]
I am here looking for work.[AN]

[FarRight]
Fresh meat, huh.[AN]
You look tougher than these little[N]
kids I've been getting recently,[AN]
at least. Welcome aboard...[AN]
Erm...[AN]

[Left][Beat][AN]

[FarRight]
Your name?[AN]

[Left]
I am called Artemer.[AN]

[FarRight]
Right, Artemer.[N]
I'm Spike.[AN]
The rest of you lot[N]
can talk later.[AN]
Helena, give the[N]
briefing, please.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Right.[AN]
It seems like the locals have been[N]
getting robbed more and more lately.[AN]
Those bandits are awful bold of late.[AN]
They're not only taking[N]
valuables, but prisoners as well.[AN]

[Right][Clear][LoadLexi]
Prisoners...[N]
What for? Ransom?[AN]

[Left][Clear][LoadVerwald]
Wish it were so lighthearted,[N]
kid. Those are slaves.[AN]

[FarRight]
God knows what black market[N]
they're being sold on.[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][LoadKeith]
So if I'm understanding right,[AN]
we're breaking into their[N]
base and rescuing those people.[AN]

[FarLeft]
You got the jist of it.[AN]
Be on your guard though - these[N]
bandits won't be pulling punches.[AN]

[Left][Clear][LoadArtemer]
Bandits? They are weak.[AN]

[Right]
What makes you say that?[AN]

[Left]
They lack conviction.[N]
I have killed many before.[AN]
Fell for animal traps.[AN]
Made for animals much[N]
smaller than bandits.[AN]

[Right][Clear][LoadSpike]
Someone sounds sure of himself.[AN]
Say... why don't you[N]
take charge here, buddy?[AN]

[FarRight]
Him? But he just got here...[N]
I don't follow your reasoning.[AN]

[Right]
You'll get it when[N]
you're older, kid.[AN]

[Left]
Very well.[N]
I will take charge.[AN]

[Right]
Excellent.[AN]
You all go get prepared.[N]
Show this guy around.[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][Left][Clear]
[Right][MoveMidRight][FarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
He'll get it when[N]
he's older...?[AN]
Get what?[AN]

[MidRight]
He'll get that I'm too[N]
damned old to be babysitting,[AN]
that's what.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Are you sure about this?[AN]

[MidRight]
Relax. It's not like[N]
we're going anywhere.[AN]
You can show him[N]
the ropes and all that.[AN]
Now, I've got my own[N]
preparations to make,[AN]
if you'll excuse me.[AN]
[MoveFarFarLeft][Clear]

[MidLeft][CloseEyes][Beat][A][X]





##PrologueOP2
[FarFarLeft][LoadSpike][MoveLeft]
Alright, here's[N]
the place.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadHelena][FarLeft][LoadKeith]
It's... bigger[N]
than I expected.[AN]

[Left]
Helena, if you would.[AN]
[Left][Clear][FarLeft][Clear]

[MidRight]
We're going to focus[N]
on those prisoners.[AN]
Once we open a cell,[AN]
we'll lead them out[N]
here to get them away.[AN][Event]
Some townsfolk have[N]
wagons prepared there.[AN]
After they're all out,[AN]
we need to reclaim[N]
this fort as well.[AN][Event]
That means we need to[N]
defeat their leader,[AN]
but doing so early[N]
may be benificial.[AN]

[Left][LoadVerwald]
Nice and simple, huh?[AN]
Come in swinging and[N]
bust them outta there...[AN][CloseEyes][....][....][OpenEyes][MoveLeft]
I like it![AN]

[FarLeft][LoadLexi]
But how are we going[N]
to open the cells?[AN]

[MidRight]
I brought an unlock staff with me.[AN]
The local blacksmith was also kind[N]
enough to give us this master key.[AN]
Artemer can hold onto it for now.[AN]

[Left][Clear][LoadArtemer]
Thank you.[AN]

[FarLeft][Clear][LoadSpike]
If there's no complaints,[N]
let's move already.[AN]
Lead the way, bud.[AN]

[Left]
I will do[N]
my best.[A][X]




##PrologueOP3
[MidRight][LoadGregory][FarFarLeft][LoadPirate][MoveMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Boss![N]
We've got trouble![AN]
Some mercenaries[N]
'ave showed up![AN]

[MidRight]
Those lowly villagers[N]
must have sent them...[AN]
Bastards ought to know[N]
their place in this world.[AN]
We can handle this[N]
lot, no problem.[AN]
Call for the reinforcements![AN]
And if those slave runts[N]
try to escape, kill 'em![AN]
That'll send 'em right on[N]
back into their cells.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sir, yes sir![AN]
[MoveFarFarRight][Clear]

[MidRight][Beat][AN]
Alright, you lug.[N]
[MoveMidLeft][Clear][LoadGregory]
I see you sulking about.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadXanthus]
Hopefully that eyesight of yours[N]
helps you oversee those prisoners.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hmph. You'd do best[N]
to watch your tongue.[AN]
Leave my own business[N]
to me, you snake.[AN]
You'll get your[N]
damned people,[AN]
to whatever ends you[N]
freaks are using them.[AN]

[MidRight]
As long as you hold[N]
your end of our deal.[AN][Smile]
Try not to kill too[N]
many in the meantime, hm?[AN][Smile]
[Clear]

[MidLeft]
I have a feeling I'm involved[N]
in something I shouldn't be...[A][X]




##PrologueGregoryBattle
[MidLeft][LoadGregory]
Didn't expect ya to make it[N]
it all the way up here...[AN]
Looks like I'll get to[N]
have some fun with ya![A][X]




##PrologueGregoryDeath
[MidLeft][LoadGregory]
This ain't... the end[N]
of me... Ya... Urgh...[A][CloseEyes][.....][X]




##ProloguePrisonerWarning
[MidRight][LoadArtemer][MidLeft][LoadSpike]
What the hell are[N]
you doing, pal?[AN]
If these people all die,[N]
we ain't gettin' paid![AN]

[MidRight]
I apoligize.[N]
I lack experience.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Just... try[N]
to focus, huh?[A][X]




##ProloguePrisonerLose
[MidRight][LoadArtemer][MidLeft][LoadSpike]
Another one?![N]
God damnit...[AN]

[MidRight][Beat][AN]

[MidLeft]
Just step aside, bud.[AN]
I'll handle[N]
things from here.[AN]
What a mess...[A][X]




##PrologueCell1
[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadOldMan]
Oh, thank heavens![AN]
I was worried we'd be[N]
locked up here for good...[AN]
Let's get out of[N]
here while we can![A][X]




##PrologueCell2
[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadMerry]
Hm? What's[N]
this about?[A][X]




##PrologueCell3
[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadKelikGirl]
Are we... being rescued?[N]
I don't know what to say.[AN]
...Thank you.[A][X]




##PrologueCell4
[MidRight][LoadCurrent][FarLeft][LoadBraidGirl][Left][LoadYoungMan]
Ah, we're saved![AN]

[FarLeft][HalfCloseEyes]
The light hurts my[N]
eyes after so long...[A][X]




##PrologueSeizeStart
[MidRight][LoadArtemer][MidLeft][LoadSpike]
Alright, that's[N]
the last of them.[AN]
Artemer, you go take[N]
control of the throne.[AN]

[MidRight]
Right.[A][X]




##PrologueSeizeBefore
[MidRight][LoadArtemer][MidLeft][LoadSpike]
I know you're new here,[AN]
but we still have[N]
prisoners to rescue.[AN]
Try to keep your[N]
eyes open, bud.[AN]

[MidRight]
My apologies.[A][X]





##PrologueArtemerMerry
[MidRight][LoadArtemer][MidLeft][LoadMerry]
Oh my, aren't you[N]
a strong one...[AN]

[MidRight]
True strength is of[N]
the mind, not the body.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Er... right.[AN]
Are you breaking me out,[N]
or giving me life advice?[AN]

[MidRight]
I apologize.[AN]
You are free[N]
now, young one.[AN]
We will defend[N]
you as you escape.[AN]
[MoveFarFarLeft][Clear]

[MidLeft]
Hmm... wait...[AN]
if they protect[N]
me while I...[AN]
[MoveMidRight][Clear][MidRight][LoadMerry]
Hey! Sir! Wait![AN]


[FarFarLeft][LoadArtemer][MoveMidLeft]
Yes?[AN]

[MidRight]
Since you were[N]
so kind to me...[AN]
how about[N]
I repay the favor?[AN]
I'm pretty deft[N]
with my hands,[AN]
and not too shabby[N]
with a bow either.[AN]

[MidLeft]
You wish to assist us?[AN]
...Very well.[N]
Come with me, then.[AN]

[MidRight]
Oh, of course,[N]
of course![AN]
Heheheh.[A][X]




##PrologueKeithMerry
[MidLeft][LoadMerry][MidRight][LoadKeith]
Merry?![AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh, hey Keith![AN]

[MidRight]
Argh, you little...[AN]
didn't I tell you[N]
to quit thieving?[AN]

[MidLeft]
It's not like[N]
I have a choice![AN]
You know how it is![AN]

[MidRight]
Yes yes, I was there, but...[AN]
surely you could figure[N]
something else out.[AN]
Look where it's gotten you.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I have figured something out![AN]
I'll have you know I'm[N]
not even a thief anymore.[AN]
The only thing I[N]
steal is information.[AN]
Yup, I'm a spy now.[AN]

[MidRight]
Oh, so you're a[N]
spy now, is that it?[AN]
You're still making your[N]
living hiding in shadows...[AN]
Is this really what you[N]
want of yourself?[AN]
What your brother wanted?[AN]

[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Don't go bringing[N]
him into this![AN]
Besides, have you[N]
got a better idea?![AN]
Since you're so[N]
smart, Mr. Genius![AN]

[MidRight][CloseEyes]
...You know what? Yeah, I do.[AN][OpenEyes]
Come with me. You're doing[N]
some honest work, for once.[AN]
[MoveFarLeft][MoveFarLeft]

[Left]
Hey, what are you...[AN][FarLeft][MoveFarFarLeft][MidLeft][MoveFarLeft]
Hey! Let me go! Ugh![AN]
I can come by[N]
myself, you know![A][X]




##PrologueEnding1
[Left][LoadHelena][Right][LoadArtemer][FarRight][LoadVerwald][FarLeft][LoadSpike]
Looks like that's a wrap.[AN]
Not too shabby, bud.[N]
For your first go.[AN]

[Right]
Thank you.[AN]

[FarRight]
Guess all that's left[N]
is to get paid. Gahaha![AN]

[Left]
It's already pretty late.[AN]
We should rest[N]
here for the night.[AN]

[FarLeft][Clear][LoadKeith]
I'm going to take[N]
a look around.[AN]
Surely they have some[N]
food stockpiled somewhere.[AN]

[FarRight]
Food, eh?[AN][Smile]
Now you're talking, pal![N]
Let's check 'er out![AN][Smile]

[Left][Clear][LoadLexi]
Must you always[N]
be so loud...?[A][X]





##PrologueEnding2
[MidRight][LoadHelena][MidLeft][LoadSpike][CloseEyes]
[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]

[MidRight]
You noticed it too.[AN]

[MidLeft]
You don't get this[N]
old without knowing...[AN]
When something's[N]
just not right.[AN]
I couldn't see them[N]
with my eyes, but...[AN]

[MidRight][MoveRight][FarFarRight][LoadArtemer][MoveFarRight]
A male. About 127 pounds.[N]
A bit under 6 feet tall.[AN]

[MidLeft]
How could you...?[AN]

[FarRight]
A hunter knows what to listen for.[N]
This is what my father taught me.[AN]

[Right]
You don't suspect he's the one[N]
who was buying the slaves...?[AN]

[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
I see no other reason[N]
to be sneaking around.[AN][OpenEyes]
Well, it's none of[N]
our business anyways.[AN]
Unless we're getting[N]
paid for it. [Smile][MoveMidLeft][....]Heh.[AN][Smile]

[Right][CloseEyes]
Still...[AN][OpenEyes]

[FarRight]
They are gone now.[N]
Should I track them...?[AN]

[Right]
No, don't worry about it.[N]
If we need to deal with them...[AN]
We'll do it when that time comes.[AN]

[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
Hopefully never.[A][X]
